HGTVDownloader v0.1
==============

Automatically downloads full seasons of all TV shows from the HGTV.ca website

Usage: Set download location inside the script, then run it :) Skips re-downloading shows that have already been downloaded.

Makes use of [RTMPDump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) - A custom-compiled version with some reworked output is included to look pretty when combined with the downloader. All credit for RTMPDump goes to Andrej Stepanchuk & Howard Chu.
