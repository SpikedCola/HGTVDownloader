HGTVDownloader v0.2
==============

Automatically downloads full seasons of all TV shows from the HGTV.ca website

Usage: Set download location inside the script, then run it :) 
Features: 
 - Groups shows by Category/Show/Season
 - Skips re-downloading episodes that have already been downloaded.
 - "Finished Shows" list to skip parsing episodes for completed shows
 - Automatically retries if a download fails or times out
 - Handles "Outtakes"/"Timelapse/etc" extras

Makes use of [RTMPDump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) - A custom-compiled version with some reworked output is included to look pretty when combined with the downloader. All credit for RTMPDump goes to Andrej Stepanchuk & Howard Chu.
